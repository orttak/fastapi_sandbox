I use docker compose in my local machine and my app directory under main folder so it creates problems when I deploy app to heroku.
So I have to upload subfolder which name is "src" to heroku.
deploy heroku with subfolder
add app git folder to remote
 > heroku create app orttak-fastapi-crud
 > heroku git:remote -a orttak-fastapi-crud
push the target folder which has Procfile and app python
 > git subtree push --prefix src/ heroku master

 After deploy the app we should define new DB for our app. For this purpose we istall heroku postgresql instance and 
 initlaize with our app. For this settings, under app setting, go got "Config Vars" and define your variable which should be same as the ".env" file

Last step in heroku, you should apply your Alembic configuration to your app. For this purpose, go to "Migrate" and apply your migration.
In CMD "heroku run "alembic upgrade head" " and "heroku ps:restart" 

note:restart app > heroku ps:restart
